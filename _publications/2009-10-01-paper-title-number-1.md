excerpt: 'The swift rise of internet users in Nepal has proliferated the amount of content uploaded by the day. The advent of many platforms has evolved from simple text based communications allowing the users to share content in the form of audio and video. While this has provided the users with flexibility, it has also made it difficult to search for relevant content on the internet. This is more so the case for low resource languages like Nepali, where speech recognition systems have not evolved as it has for resource rich languages like English. This project proposes a semi-supervised Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and classifier in the form of a web interface which classifies audio/video based on its content. The shortcomings of low resource language is mitigated in supervised approach by using wav2vec 2.0, a self-supervised framework for learning contextualized representations. The english wav2vec 2.0 and Cross Lingual Speech Representations for Indic Languages (CLSRIL-23) model trained on indic languages is pretrained and finetuned on Open Speech and Language Resources (OpenSLR) dataset to create a Nepali ASR. The CLSRIL-23 model outperforms the wav2vec 2.0 model in most test sets achieveing a word error rate of 23.05 in OpenSLR female dataset. For classification, Multilingual Representations for Indian Languages (MuRIL) model, a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) based model trained on indic languages is utilized to classify the transcriptions generated among a set of categories. The MuRIL
model achieves 92.06 percent accuracy. The overall Machine Learning (ML) pipeline is en-
compassed in a web application whereby classified and transcribed videos can be searched
on the basis of their content.'
