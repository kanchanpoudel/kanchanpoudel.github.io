An aspiring Machine Learning researcher with a strong enthusiasm for leveraging the power of computational problem-solving to make a positive difference. My main focus is on Computer Vision, Vision Language Models, and Speech Recognition Systems for low-data regimes. Currently, I am actively involved in these areas at NAAMII, where I have also been developing an AI-assisted tool for cervical cancer screening in resource-constrained environments.
